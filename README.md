## Previous iterations

I've used this project as a learning experience over the years.
I've iterated on many different solutions (serverless, MERN etc.) but have landed on the cheapest, fastest and most scalable solution: a static site on AWS.

Here are the previous iterations:

-   [V3](https://github.com/nicholascannon/portfolio-v3) (Serverless)

-   [V2](https://github.com/nicholascannon/portfolio2.0) (MERN stack)

-   [V1 frontend](https://github.com/nicholascannon/portfolio) & [V1 backend](https://github.com/nicholascannon/portfolio-backend)
